      <p class="textright">Sitting in the sun, away from everyone who had done him
       harm in the past, he quietly listened to those who roamed by. He felt at
       peace in the moment, hoping it would last, but knowing the reprieve would
        soon come to an end. He closed his eyes, the sun beating down on face and
       he smiled. He smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember.</p>

       <p class="textleft">It's always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike.
         If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't have to worry.
          Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to
         learn that day. </p>

         <p class="textcenter">Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen
           early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame
           high in the atmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an
           ordinary falling star. It seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred
           miles east of him.</p>

        <p class="textjustify">I recently discovered I could make fudge with just chocolate chips,
           sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and a thick pot on slow heat.
          I tried it with dark chocolate chunks and I tried it with semi-sweet
          chocolate chips. It's better with both kinds. It comes out pretty bad with
          just the dark chocolate. The best add-ins are crushed almonds and marshmallows
           -- what you get from that is Rocky Road. It takes about twenty minutes from
          start to fridge, and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty
          pounds you gain from eating it. All things in moderation, friends. All things
         in moderation.</p>

        <p class="textspace">She tried not to judge him. His ratty clothes and unkempt hair
          made him look homeless. Was he really the next Einstein as she had been told?
          On the off chance it was true, she continued to try not to judge him.</p>

        <p class="textheight">The boy walked down the street in a carefree way, playing without
          notice of what was about him. He didn't hear the sound of the car as his ball
           careened into the road. He took a step toward it, and in doing so sealed
          his fate.</p>
